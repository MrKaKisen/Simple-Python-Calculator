# Simple-Python-Calculator
This is a really simple Python calculator, one of the first programs I've ever made through python. No GUI or anything.

Also, please check out my website at http://mrkakisen.se/

# Known errors
- Having python installed, and just dubble pressing "calculator.py" and make a calculation, the window will close so fast that you will not even get to read it. hotfix: use cmd and run "python calculator.py"
